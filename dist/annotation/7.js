The Author's Note from the next chapter is relevant here: One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means this is going to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that FFN does not allow me any larger font size in which to say NO. It honestly hadn't occurred to me that Luna might be a real seer - I'll have to decide whether to run with that or not - but I think we can all safely assume that if Luna is a seer, she said something about \"light planting a seed in darkness\", and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted this in rather the wrong way. So it's possible that the subsequent prophecies were real because the author decided it was a fun idea, and this one just dates from before that realization. It's also possible that this prophecy will become literally true in the Epilogue, which has not yet been written.","id":"hpmor-7-19","replacement":"<span id=\"hpmor-7-19\" annotation=\"hpmor-7-19\" class=\"hpmor-annotations-span\"><em>BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS<br> DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT</em></span>"},"hpmor-7-20":{"disambiguation":{"expect":1,"useIndex":0},"subjects":[],"tags":["spoiler"],"text":"\"I have a tutor who says that,\" Draco allowed.
