The Author's Note from the next chapter is relevant here: One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means this is going to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that FFN does not allow me any larger font size in which to say NO. It honestly hadn't occurred to me that Luna might be a real seer - I'll have to decide whether to run with that or not - but I think we can all safely assume that if Luna is a seer, she said something about \"light planting a seed in darkness\", and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted this in rather the wrong way.
