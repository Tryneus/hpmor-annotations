Voldemort opened the chamber of secrets 5 decades ago, and Slytherin's
monster killed a student.

It's possible that the cloak did, in fact, know that Harry would need
it to play the prank on himself.  HPMOR has fewer coincidences than

If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he
would never let it escape his grasp until the day he died.
```

* spoiler
* original

The cloak was left by Dumbledore, just like in the original, probably
as part of his **prophecy-threading** project.  (TODO: reference)

Shortly after Harry receives the cloak, Dumbledore will conspicuously
*not* steal it, even though he has the opportunity to, and will tell
Harry that Harry should be more suspicious next time somebody says not
to trust him (17/`I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we
must all do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice
and ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to
distrust me.`).  Assuming that he didn't write the note this way just
because the prophecies told him to, it seems likely that he did it in
order to make Harry trust him more by proving a strawman wrong.
