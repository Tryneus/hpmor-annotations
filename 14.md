A flash-forward to later in the chapter.

This might be here as a reminder of the Author's note from the
previous chapter (13/`I solemnly swear that there is a logical,
foreshadowed, canon-compliant explanation for everything which happens
in this chapter.`).

It might also be a reference to the fact that later in the chapter
Harry decides that the Universe might operate on principles which make
it literally impossible for his brain to understand certain things.

"Well, yes, of course," Harry said. There was no need to admit how
long it had taken him to actually think of that. "As opposed to, say,
trying to research it myself, or telling any of the other children."

This is poking fun at the original series - the other path sounds more
typical of the main characters' antics.

"And if, perhaps, you were to discover the entrance to Salazar

and Ron discover the chamber and explore it themselves, without
bringing it to the attention of the school administrators.

"Mr. Potter," McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, "five

Hogwarts, and I am now certain that five decades ago was the last time
someone heard that message."

* original

Voldemort opened the chamber of secrets 5 decades ago, and Slytherin's
monster killed a student.

Apparently that business with refusing offers of monetary rewards
until you got a magic item actually worked in real life, not just
computer games.
```

* reference

In many computer games, particularly RPGs, upon completing a quest the
player is usually given a reward.  If the player refuses that reward,
the quest-giver will usually offer a different means of compensation.
From a balance perspective, this is typically done so a player doesn't
feel discouraged from playing a certain type of character.  In a
similar way, McGonagall is trying to find a way to encourage Harry to
be good by rewarding this behavior.

It's not fair to the other children if I earn lots of points for

wizarding world, it is also a jab at the source material.

The perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it

This gift was from Dumbledore in the original series, and given to

accelerated like many other things in this series.

It seems to expect you to have need of it. Use it well.

It's possible that the cloak did, in fact, know that Harry would need
it to play the prank on himself.  HPMOR has fewer coincidences than
most stories.

```
If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he
would never let it escape his grasp until the day he died.
```

* spoiler
* original

The cloak was left by Dumbledore, just like in the original, probably
as part of his **prophecy-threading** project (79/`"Albus," Minerva
said, surprised at how steady her own voice was, "did you leave those
notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?"`).

Dumbledore also posesses the Elder Wand, another Deathly Hallow, which
changes hands when its owner is defeated, an event which Dumbledore
expects to coincide with his death.

Shortly after Harry receives the cloak, Dumbledore will conspicuously
*not* steal it, even though he has the opportunity to, and will tell
Harry that Harry should be more suspicious next time somebody says not
to trust him (17/`I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we
must all do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice
and ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to
distrust me.`).  Assuming that he didn't write the note this way just
because the prophecies told him to, it seems likely that he did it in
order to make Harry trust him more by proving a strawman wrong.
