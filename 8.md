She wished some other girl would just walk up to her and say,
"Hermione, the teacher told me to be friends with you."
```

* subtle

Harry believes that Professor McGonagall told him to find Hermione
Granger on the train.

```
"Technically, all I needed to do was look for you, but it seems likely
that I'm meant to talk to you or invite you to join my party or get a
key magical item from you or find out that Hogwarts was built over the
ruins of an ancient temple or something. PC or NPC, that is the
question?"
```

D&D reference.

Don't worry, I don't bite anyone who doesn't bite me first.

Harry promised this to Professor McGonagall (2/`bite me first`).

```
The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts claims that you survived because of
your mother's love and that your scar contains all of the Dark Lord's
magical power and that the centaurs fear you
```

* spoiler

His mother's love had nothing to do with it.  His scar doesn't contain
all of the Dark Lord's magical power, although the scar is tied in
some way to the **sense of doom** he feels around Quirrell, and thus
probably to his **mysterious dark side**.  Centaurs (or at least some
centaurs) do in fact fear him.

Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she'd ever
wanted anything.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Harry buys her one of these pouches for her Birthday, partially
because she's his friend, but also perhaps partially because of the
human tendency for Reciprocation discussed in the previous chapter
(22/`pouch for her birthday`).

Harry Potter hissed at that, a frightening sort of sound that could
