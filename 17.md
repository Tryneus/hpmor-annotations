```
There couldn't possibly be anything he could master on the first try
which would baffle Hermione, and if there was and it turned out to be
broomstick riding instead of anything intellectual, Harry would just
die.
```

* original

This is, in fact, the case in the original series.

---

```
The Remembrall was glowing bright red in his hand, blazing like a
miniature sun that cast shadows on the ground in broad daylight.
```

* spoiler

Harry has forgotten an entire life as Voldemort.  See the page on his
**mysterious dark side**.

---

```
Harry blinked. "But then I'd have lost -"
```

* foreshadowing

Harry has a mental blindspot with regard to plans that require him to
lose.  Professor Quirrell is going to try to remedy this shortly
(19/`how to lose`).

---

```
"What do I get if I can make it happen on the last day of the school
year?"
```

* foreshadowing

Harry comes very close to this, although it's not clear how "last day"
is defined.

Possibly the Holy Grail, filled with the blood of Christ.  Might also
be a reference to the Holy Grail from Fate/Stay Night, although that
hole grail isn't wooden.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail)

```
one of the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from
the gaze of Death himself.
```

* foreshadowing

The true meaning of this is that the cloak allows you to hide from
dementors.

---

```
And so I cannot help but wonder if by some strange chance you have
found not just an invisibility cloak, but the Cloak of Invisibility
```

* spoiler

Note that the cloak was left by Dumbledore, just like in the original,
probably as part of his **prophecy-threading** project (79/`"Albus,"
Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice was, "did you
leave those notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?"`).  That's the real way
he knows Harry has it, not the story-logic he gives as part of his
plan to pretend to be insane.

---

```
I will only ask that you think twice and ponder three times again, the
next time someone tells you to distrust me.
```

* spoiler

Since Dumbledore is the one who left him the cloak, it's likely that
he added the note specifically so that he could have this moment where
Harry's doubts proved unfounded.

---

```
Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible effort. "Ah,
Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is that you begin
laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny, because when
you're wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!" The old wizard wiped
tears away from his eyes. "Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft evil will shall evil
mar indeed, in very deed."
```

* spoiler

Dumbledore knows the truth about Harry's **mysterious dark side**, or
at least mostly understands it.  The joke he's getting is that Tom
Riddle's own cold, calculating intelligence is now being turned toward
redeeming Draco Malfoy.

---

```
Dumbledore nodded. "But just because I can't think of a reason doesn't
mean there is no reason."
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

It's likely Dumbledore is telling Harry to carry the rock around as
part of his **prophecy-threading** project.  Harry later uses the rock
to kill the troll that killed Hermione.  (89/`The troll's head blew
off its spine as the rock expanded back into its old form`)

"I'm feeling thirsty," Harry said, "and that is not at all a good

This is the **comed-tea** warning Harry that something which would
make him choke is about to happen.

potion of eagle's splendour
```

* reference

A D&D potion which increases charisma.

---

```
Scrawled in the margin was a handwritten annotation saying, I wonder
what would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of
blueberries? and immediately beneath was a reply in different
handwriting, You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.
```

* spoiler

Dumbledore was writing instructions on how to turn the potion of
eagle's splendor into a potion which makes someone permanently more
beatiful, as part of his **prophecy-threading** project.  Lily gave
the improved potion to Petunia (1/`I drank this potion and I was sick
for weeks`), which led to her marrying Michael Verres instead of
Vernon Dursley, which is why Harry is so well-educated.

---

```
let's call them sneezes
```

* speculation

I've always assumed these were orgasms, based on the principle that
any obscure reference about which you have no other information except
that it's being withheld from children is probably sexual in nature.

---

```
And this one with the golden wibblers is my own invention and Minerva
is never, ever going to figure out what it's doing.
```

* foreshadowing

This is mentioned one more time after Dumbledore dies and Minerva
takes over as headmistress.  The exact use is never revealed.

(119/`Minerva's hand passed over one of those objects, the one with
golden wibblers, her eyes closing briefly.`)

---

```
Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then the same hand sifted
through the ashes and turned up a small yellowish egg.
```

* subtle

Dumbledore fished the egg out of his pocket like an incompetent stage
magician, probably to make Harry think he's insane.

---

```
Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing at him intently.
```

* subtle
* spoiler
* speculation

It's possible Dumbledore is using legilimency here to check his
story.  (He asked what they do so that those thoughts would be on the
surface of Harry's mind and he wouldn't have to go deeper.)

---

```
I wanted to tell you as early as possible, in case something happens
to one of us later, that I am truly, truly sorry. For everything that
has already happened, and everything that will.
```

* foreshadowing

Dumbledore is later locked outside of time.

---

```
"I understand," said Dumbledore. "One last thing then, Harry. You are
not to attempt the forbidden door on the third-floor corridor. There's
no possible way you could get through all the traps, and I wouldn't
want to hear that you'd been hurt trying. Why, I doubt that you could
so much as open the first door, since it's locked and you don't know
the spell Alohomora -"
```

* original

A jab at the original series, where the super-secure chamber holding
the Philosopher's stone is secured in such a way that first-year
students can enter.  In HPMOR, it's a clever trap for Voldemort which
the Headmaster pretends is a fake set of traps designed as on obstacle
course for Gryffindors trying to get to the "forbidden" thing at the
end.
