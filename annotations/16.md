A reference to "The enemy's gate is down", an insight from Ender's
Game that in zero-gravity you can orient yourself whichever way you want.
(Probably meant to be an example of lateral thinking.)

akin to a major univeristy classroom
```

* original
* foreshadowing

The Defence class in general is a large departure from the original
series, but to portray the classroom as such shows that Quirrell is
not as antiquated as the rest of the wizarding world, and is open
to taking ideas from Muggles.

Now what does that remind me of...?

This may be referring to Harry's opinions of most of his teachers
before he began being home-schooled.

Harry didn't particularly feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.

```
oh my god you have minions
```

* original

This is a bit of a prod at the source material, in which Draco is
first portrayed the stereotypical villain with minions in his own
class.  Here, it is explained how such a thing happens, which only
serves to make it seem more ridiculous.  The minions themselves,
Crabbe and Goyle, hamfistedly employ every stereotypical minion action
available to them, perhaps an explanation of how stupid the characters
were in the original series.

Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of
Professor Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle television.
```

* subtle

This is one of the first hints that Quirrell knows a surprising amount
about Muggle technology -- enough to have clever ideas related to it.

```
Most fearsome of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in
continuously maintaining a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is
always transforming into its own body.
```

* foreshadowing
* spoiler

This comes into play later.  Because of this property, mountain trolls
can be transfigured into something small, smuggled somewhere, and then
untransfigured (normally this would kill the creature).  (108/`I wore
the mountain troll as a false tooth`)

Likewise if you are facing the second most perfect killing machine, a
Dementor.
```

* spoiler
* subtle

This is the first hint about the nature of Dementors in HPMOR -- the
killing curse doesn't work on them, so by Quirrell's logic they can't
have brains, and yet they're capable of complicated actions.

No, there is exactly one monster which can threaten you once you are

Note that he does not say these monsters can't threaten you *before*
you are fully grown.  And, in fact, a troll later kills Hermione.

I was in Slytherin and I am offering to formulate a cunning plot on

* spoiler
* subtle
* foreshadowing

Professor Quirrell was in Ravenclaw in both HPMOR and the original
timeline.  This is Voldemort pretending to mess up and leak that he is
not professor Quirrell.  Later it comes out that his plan was to
pretend to be David Munroe pretending to be professor Quirrell.
(84/`But I shall tell a story`).

This is a reference to Star Wars: Episode VI where Luke Skywalker
trains to use a lightsaber by deflecting shots from a flying spherical
drone, under the supervision of Ben Kenobi.

"No," said Hermione Granger.
```

* foreshadowing
* spoiler

This scene sets the stage for a major theme throughout the rest of the
series.  Quirrell is a corrupting force, constantly pushing Harry to
bend and break rules for seemingly good reasons.  Meanwhile, Hermione
is a force for good, trying to save Harry from his dark side and
reminding him that some things cannot be compromised.

Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely
Professor Quirrell was too smart for that...

Professor Quirrell is, in fact, intensely aware of the fact that Harry
is not immune to the killing curse.

"My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye socket

In the original series, Harry sticks a wand up a troll's nose during a
fight.

"My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye socket
```

* foreshadowing

In HPMOR, Harry kills the troll he fights by sticking his wand into
its brain through its eye socket and transfiguring a cross-section of
it into sulfuric acid (89/`His wand jammed through the troll's left
eye`).
