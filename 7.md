```
It's like she's afraid she'll never see me again, the thought popped
into Harry's head. He knew the thought was true but he didn't know why
Mum was so afraid.
```

* speculation

Harry thinks his mom is worried that magic will come between them, but
he doesn't consider that his mom might instead be worried about how
her sister died in a magical war 10 years ago (although it's unclear
how much she knows about the circumstances of her sister's death in
this universe).

```
There were no questions about his father accompanying him to the
magical side of King's Cross Station. Dad had trouble just looking at
Harry's trunk directly. Magic ran in families, and Michael
Verres-Evans couldn't even walk.
```

* spoiler

This is a very confusing comment, as it's later claimed that genetic
predisposition to magic is basically discrete -- you're muggle, squib,
or wizard, depending on how many copies of a recessive gene you have,
with nothing in-between (23/`either you have two stones or you
don't. Either you're a wizard or not.`).  It's possible that his
father simply has a psychological block.

It's like someone took a real game and grafted on this pointless extra

"They won't change the game just 'cause you say so!"

"I am the Boy-Who-Lived, you know. People will listen to me. And maybe
if I can persuade them to change the game at Hogwarts, the innovation
will spread.
```

* foreshadowing
* spoiler

Eventually, Harry gets a wish from Professor Quirrell, and he wishes
for Hogwarts to play Quidditch without the snitch (34/`in Hogwarts we
should play Quidditch without the Snitch`), which Quirrell
accomplishes with a clever plot (116/`His last plot`).

"Where's the famous Weasley family rat?"
```

* original
* spoiler

In the original series, the Weasley family rat is a transformed Peter
Pettigrew.  In HPMOR it was a normal rat that Bill Weasley thought was
Peter Pettigrew because he had a schizophrenic break (29/`She would've
died. "A rat."`).

```
"Um... his mother helped me figure out how to get to this platform
from the King's Cross Station, so it was kind of hard to tell him to
get lost. And it's not that I hate this Ron guy," Harry said, "I just,
just..." Harry searched for words.

"Don't see any reason for him to exist?" offered Draco.

"Pretty much."
```

* original

In the original series, Ron was a major character.  Critics might
describe him as a boring foil to Harry.

"You're welcome. Though one of the assistants must've sworn her

```
The way Lucius was looking at you, I thought he was going to c-crucify
you."
```

* speculation
* spoiler

It's not clear why Harry stumbles on the word `crucify` here.  It may
be that his **mysterious dark side**'s patterns started completing the
word to `crucio`, and he had to correct himself.

---

```
"I'll think about it," Harry said in a neutral voice. He shook his
head in wonder. "So you really are his one weak point. Huh."
```

* spoiler

This is a little suspicious, and is also referenced later in the
chapter.  It's possible that this information is actually coming from
Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

---

```
BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS
DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT
```

* spoiler
* speculation

Another of the lines that **ship Harry and Draco**.

The first of **Luna's prophecies**, and also the most irritating.  All
of the other prophecies turn out to be true in an extremely literal,
if surprising, way.  This one doesn't appear to have a similar literal
correspondence.

The Author's Note from the next chapter is relevant here:

```
One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means this
is going to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that FFN does
not allow me any larger font size in which to say NO. It honestly
hadn't occurred to me that Luna might be a real seer - I'll have to
decide whether to run with that or not - but I think we can all safely
assume that if Luna is a seer, she said something about "light
planting a seed in darkness", and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted
this in rather the wrong way.
```

So it's possible that the subsequent prophecies were real because the
author decided it was a fun idea, and this one just dates from before
that realization.  It's also possible that this prophecy will become
literally true in the Epilogue, which has not yet been written.

"I have a tutor who says that," Draco allowed. He reached inside his
robes and scratched himself with an easy, natural motion. "Who've you
got in mind?"

A cold chill was coming over Harry, a chill that came with
instructions to keep his voice and face normal. Note to self:
Overthrow government of magical Britain at earliest convenience.

Blah blah **mysterious dark side** blah blah.

```
"I was thinking someday I'm going to marry that woman."
```

For some reason shipping Harry and Luna is relatively common in
fanfiction, and this may be a reference to that.

---

```
I wonder how difficult it would be to just make a list of all the top
blood purists and kill them.

They'd tried exactly that during the French Revolution, more or less -
make a list of all the enemies of Progress and remove everything above
the neck - and it hadn't worked out well from what Harry recalled.
```

* spoiler

Harry does, in fact, behead all of the top blood purists during his
final confrontation with Voldemort (114/`Harry wasn't looking there,
he didn't see the falling masks, the blood,`).

```
Very carefully, now... the bait is set, now the hook... "If you can
learn to think of yourself as a human instead of a wizard then you can
train and refine your powers as a human."
```

* subtle

Draco thinking of himself as a human would be one of many steps in
broadening his moral sphere to include more than his immediate
political allies.

```
Harry gave an evil laugh, it just seemed to come naturally at that
point.

Blah blah **mysterious dark side** blah blah.

"Hello, Mr. Bronze," said one of the masked figures. "Can we interest
you in joining the Order of Chaos?"
```

The figures are Fred and George Weasley.  They want Harry to help them
troll Neville Longbottom.

---

```
I would say that you had been so fortunate as to meet someone who
enjoys the intimate confidence of our friend and valuable ally,
Severus Snape.
```

* spoiler

The implication seems to be that Harry somehow has information he
would only have if he enjoyed Severus Snapes's confidence, perhaps
because that information is leaking over from his **mysterious dark
side**.
