Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line...

(black robes, falling)

...blood spills out in litres, and someone screams a word.
```

Flash-forward to when Harry kills the death eaters (114/`(Black robes,
falling.)`).  The fragment of silver/fraction of a line is the
transfigured spider silk, the black robes falling are the death
eaters, and the word is Harry screaming "STUPORFY".

"And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses,
like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur
told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for
it."
```

A centaur calls him "Son of Lily" (101/`All I can say, son of Lily`),
and then tries to kill him, after asking whether the Muggles say that
soon the skies will be empty (a reference to the **second prophecy**
about Harry tearing apart the stars in heaven (89/`TEAR APART THE VERY
STARS IN HEAVEN`)).  It's thus quite plausible that the centaurs did
in fact warn Lily that being nice to her sister would cause the end of
the world.

"Anyway," Petunia said, her voice small, "she gave in. She told me it
was dangerous, and I said I didn't care any more, and I drank this
potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared
up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people were nice
to me," her voice broke, "and after that I couldn't hate my sister any
more, especially when I learned what her magic brought her in the end
-"
```

Dumbledore gave the recipe for this potion to Lily (17/`You'd get sick
for weeks and maybe die`) (119/`I wrote a strange hint in your
mother's Potions textbook, having no idea why I must; and this proved
to show Lily how to help her sister, and ensured you would gain
Petunia Evans's heartfelt love.`) as part of his
**prophecy-threading** project.

Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was
real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from
the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
```

This "part of Harry" is likely his **mysterious dark side**.

Don't believe everything you think, one of his books had said.

This is probably "Don't Believe Everything You Think: The 6 Basic
Mistakes We Make in Thinking".
