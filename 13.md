Asking the Wrong Questions
```

* title
* spoiler

A reference to later in the chapter, when Harry does in fact ask the
wrong questions and get penalized for it in the game.

```
Elen sila J. K. Rowling omentielvo
```

* note
* reference

From the Elvish phrase "Elen sila lumenn' omentielvo" -- "A star
shines upon the hour of our meeting".  Oddly enough, the author chose
to replace "lumenn'" with H.K. Rowling's name, when "lumenn'" is the
part of the sentence meaning "upon the hour".

---

```
"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever heard."
```

* title-quote
* speculation

A flash-forward to later in the chapter.  This note may be intended to
prime readers to be thinking in terms of riddles from the very beginning.

---

```
"I haven't forgotten" were written in a different style, as if he was
trying to tell himself something...?
```

* spoiler

He hasn't forgotton, because he wrote the note after using a
**Time-Turner**.

Harry gets a Time-Turner this morning, and decides to go back and
troll himself.  The entire game is perpetrated by him.

---

```
Please play the game. You can only play the game once in a
lifetime. This is an irreplaceable opportunity.
```

* spoiler

You can only play the game once in a lifetime, within 6 hours of
learning about **Time-Turner**s.

```
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME:

you do not know the rules of the game
you do not know the stakes of the game
you do not know the objective of the game
you do not know who controls the game
you do not know how to end the game
```

* speculation
* spoiler

This is also a pretty good summary of the situation Harry has found
himself dropped into at Hogwarts.

---

```
Welp, that was a puzzler, all right. It was only his first day at
school and once you ruled out Dumbledore, he didn't know the name of
anyone else here who was this crazy.
```

* subtle
* spoiler

This is probably the first hint that Harry is behind the game, since
he's the only other character who has been explicitly called out as
acting a little insane and spreading chaos wherever he goes.
(5/`"What part of 'get fitted for robes' sounded to you like please
cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!"`)

Harry probably doesn't consider this hypothesis, because his actually
usually look less insane from the inside, and this is the first time
he's encountering himself from the outside.

---

```
Escher painting
```

* reference

Escher was an artist known for drawing impossible geometries.

---

```
"Are you -" Harry said, and then shut his mouth. On second thought, no
he was NOT going to ask the painting whether it was fully conscious in
the sense of being aware of its own awareness.
```

* callback

Thinking this about the sorting hat caused it to become conscious
(10/`he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely conscious in the
sense of being aware of its own awareness`).

---

```
Well then, as a general rule, if you keep on turning left, you're
bound to keep going down."

That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where he'd
heard it before.
```

* spoiler
* subtle

It's unclear exactly what this is referring to.  Several hypothesis:

* Harry's **mysterious dark side** has in fact heard this advice
  before.

* It sounds similar to the left-hand rule for solving mazes.

* It's a reference to the Left-hand Path, which is a generic occult
  term for a variety of black magics.

---

```
"That's one of the most obvious riddles I've ever heard."
```

* spoiler
* subtle
* speculation

It's worth remembering whenever you hear the word "riddle" that it
might be a reference to Tom Riddle, which can refer to either
Voldemort or Harry (due to his **mysterious dark side**).

This particular occurance is somewhat weak, however, and may just be a
coincidence.

---

```
All I can tell you is that if this were a riddle, the answer would be
that the game is life, and that while we do not make all the rules
ourselves, the one who awards or takes points is always you. If it is
not riddle but reality - then I do not know.
```

* spoiler

Harry is, in fact, the one giving and taking the points.

---

```
Minus ten points for being slow! Now you have 61 points! That was the
rest of the message!"
```

* spoiler

The fact that this random portrait already knows exactly how many
points Harry will have after having 10 deducted is a strong hint that
there's some sort of precognition in play (in this case, Harry already
observed all of this before traveling back in time).

(Either that or the mysterious force that controls the game is
controlling the portrait in some more direct way than old messages
passed through other portraits.)

---

```
"Thank you," Harry said. He was really getting behind on the game
here. "Um... I don't suppose you know where the message originally
came from, do you?"

"It was spoken by a hollow voice that belled forth from a gap within
the air itself, a gap that opened upon a fiery abyss! That's what they
told me!"
```

* spoiler

This is a foolish question, as Harry will realize later, because
anybody anywhere in the chain of messages can lie about anything
earlier in the chain.

---

```
Abracadabra
```

* original

Abracadabra sounds very close to Avada Kedavra, the killing curse.

---

```
Slowly, the largest Slytherin reached up to his head, and peeled off
the pan of cherry pie that had just draped itself over him.
```

* spoiler

Harry produced this effect by being in the hallway while under his
invisibility cloak and throwing the pie.

```
Let me warn you... messing with my life tends to make your life... a
little hairy. Get it?"
```

* subtle

Because his name is Harry.

---

```
"No," said Harry. "But when you're telling everyone this story be sure
to share it with Hermione Granger in first-year Ravenclaw, she has an
anecdote you might find amusing."
```

* callback

The anecdote is the experiment with the **Comed-Tea** on the train.

---

```
Harry smiled smugly. "I can make anything I want happen just by
snapping my fingers."
```

* spoiler

Harry will threaten to **snap his fingers** *many* times over the
course of the story.

---

```
Though it had produced an effect that might be tactically useful.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing
* subtle

This sort of thinking is representative of Harry's **mysterious dark
side**.  Later on Quirrell makes a very similar statement (60/`In a
real fight, a curse which cannot be blocked and must be dodged is an
indispensable tactic.`).

---

```
When I saw that I just got... really angry...
```

* spoiler

**mysterious dark side**

---

```
He wondered how much the Game Controller cared about that sort of
thing, and whether he'd won or lost points for it. Harry himself felt
like he'd lost quite a few points, and he was sure the old lady in the
picture would have told him that his was the only opinion that
mattered.
```

* spoiler

Yet another hint that Harry is running the game.

---

```
the Head of House Hufflepuff would be the last person anyone would
suspect, which ought to put her near the top of Harry's list.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Professor Quirrell has this same thought later in the series, and uses
Professor Sprout as his evil pawn for just this reason.

---

```
A sheet of paper flew over his head, as if someone had thrown it from
behind him
```

* spoiler

Harry is standing behind himself under his invisibility cloak.

---

```
ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS
```

* speculation

Harry is definitely asking the wrong questions.  This game implies the
existence of a bunch of new and powerful, but not necessarily hostile,
elements of the world that he doesn't understand, and he's still
concerned with whether or not it's fair and whether or not he can win.

Also, there is a certain correspondence between this and the test with
the **Comed-Tea** that Harry put Hermione through on the train.  In
both cases there's a mysterious phenomenon to investiage, and in both
cases the investigator asks entirely the wrong questions.
