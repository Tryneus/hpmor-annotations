out to predict a lot of important things.

Love as thou Rowling.

A reference to the Kushiel's Legacy saga by Jacqueline Carey.  The
deity Elau has a precept, "Love as thou wilt."

"I'm sure I'll find the time somewhere."
```

* title-quote

A flash-forward to later in the chapter.  Pretty obviously a reference
to the **Time-Turner** Harry has acquired.

```
And it was starting to look like he had a mysterious dark side.
```

This is the first time it is explicitly called a **mysterious dark
side**.

```
Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and the game where
someone knocked down your books every time you tried to pick them up
again.
```

(7/`Harry's eyes dropped downwards`)

```
Thought about what Draco Malfoy had said about the ten-year-old
Lovegood girl and how the Wizengamot really operated...
```

* backref

(7/`As soon as I'm old enough I'm going to rape her`)

```
how the Wizengamot really operated
```

* backref

(7/`Um... seat on the Wizengamot`)

```
He wanted to write someone and demand a refund on his dark side which
clearly ought to have irresistible magical power but had turned out to
be defective.

There are various overlapping tropes for this, but it is common
enough: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide

* spoiler

As it turns out, Harry is already using his mysterious dark side, it
is the reason he is not like other kids and why he has excelled so
much in his life to this point.

```
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There was no trace
of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch. "Anyone messing
around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been
warned."
```

* original
* foreshadowing

While this is the exact same intro given by McGonagall in the original
series, the rest of this scene establishes much more hard and fast
rules on Transfiguration, with more of a scientific basis.  This
foreshadows the importance that Transfiguration will play in this
series.

TODO: I have a suspicion that Harry breaks every one of the vows
sworn in this chapter - investigate

```
"You needn't apologise, Mr. Potter, if you were required to read ahead
you would have been told to do so."
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Snape, of course, is much less reasonable (18/`"Potter!" snapped the
Potions professor. "What would I get if I added powdered root of
asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"`).

---

```
Harry spoke first. "Of course you realise this means war."
```

A bit of hyperbole, but a common trope:

scales with the size of the target form
```

* subtle
* spoiler

Scales with the size of the *target* form.  Harry later uses this to
permanently maintain a transfiguration that maps a large object onto a
very small object.

```
Unless, of course, you engage in some sort of mischief and lose House
points before then. Addressing a professor disrespectfully, for
example." Professor McGonagall put a finger on her cheek and looked
reflective. "I expect you'll hit negative numbers before the end of
Friday.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Harry does, in fact, lose a great number of points for addressing
Snape disrespectfully before the end of Friday (18/`Ten more points
from Ravenclaw.`).

```
And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

A reference to Genesis 1:5.
