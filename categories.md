Categories of annotation tags:

* foreshadowing - a hint of something that will happen or be revealed in the future
* consequence - an 'internal reference' where a statement or action is directly related to an outcome or exposition in another chapter
* reference - a reference to something outside of the harry potter universe, like an academic paper or a pop-culture reference
* departure - something in the HPMoR universe that is significantly or humorously different from the original series
* original - an explanation of how a character or situation unfolded in the original that happens differently in HPMoR
* speculation - an annotation that does not have enough evidence to support it, but may be of interest


TODO:
* darkside - there are a lot of places referencing Harry's mysterious dark side that don't need explanatory text, currently they're categorized as foreshadowing, but it's a bit overkill
* distinguish academic references from pop-culture references, maybe just have two types of reference tags
* come up with a good heuristic to distinguish foreshadowing from consequences
* some foreshadowing annotations should probably be consequences
