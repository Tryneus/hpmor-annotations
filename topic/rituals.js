Darkness beyond darkness, deeper than pitchest black
Buried beneath the flow of time
From darkness to darkness, your voice echoes in the emptiness
Unknown to death, nor known to life
You who know the gate, who are the gate, the key and guardian of the gate
I bid you open the way for him, and manifest his power before me
