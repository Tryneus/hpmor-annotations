HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic

* note

Fanfiction shorthand for fiction where Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy
are in a romantic relationship involving male pregnancy, and Draco is
the bottom in the relationship.

"Allow me to warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous
sort of project, and may tend to make your life a lot more surreal."
```

* title-quote

This is a flash-forward to later in the chapter.  (Unusually for these
quotes, however, the quote later in the chapter is only approximate --
"I warn you that challenging my ingenuity is a dangerous project, and
tends to make your life a lot more surreal.".)

```
She wished some other girl would just walk up to her and say,
"Hermione, the teacher told me to be friends with you."
```

* subtle

Harry believes that Professor McGonagall told him to find Hermione
Granger on the train.

---

```
"Technically, all I needed to do was look for you, but it seems likely
that I'm meant to talk to you or invite you to join my party or get a
key magical item from you or find out that Hogwarts was built over the
ruins of an ancient temple or something. PC or NPC, that is the
question?"
```

* reference

D&D reference.

PC and NPC are terms from role-playing games, standing for Player
Character and Non-Player Character.  Harry is implying that Hermione
may or may not be interesting enough to be a full-fledged character.

```
Don't worry, I don't bite anyone who doesn't bite me first.
```

* callback

Harry promised this to Professor McGonagall (2/`bite me first`).
(Also, he bit that teacher in grade school.)

Miss Granger, it has been less than 72 hours since I went to Diagon
Alley and discovered my claim to fame.
```

* original

This is a departure from the original series.  In it, a full month
passes between Harry's shopping trip in Diagon Alley and the Hogwarts
Express.

```
The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts claims that you survived because of
your mother's love and that your scar contains all of the Dark Lord's
magical power and that the centaurs fear you
```

* spoiler
* original

In the original, Harry was saved by his mother's love.

in HPMOR, his mother's love had nothing to do with it.  His scar
doesn't contain all of the Dark Lord's magical power, although the
scar is tied in some way to the **sense of doom** he feels around
Quirrell, and thus probably to his **mysterious dark side**.  Centaurs
(or at least some centaurs) do in fact fear him.

Instantly Hermione wanted one of those pouches more than she'd ever
wanted anything.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing
* speculation

Hermione may not understand that Harry can only retrieve books that he
has put into the pouch.

Harry buys her one of these pouches for her Birthday, partially
because she's his friend, but also perhaps partially because of the
human tendency for Reciprocation discussed in the previous chapter
(22/`pouch for her birthday`).

"Well, maybe this will impress you," the boy said. He leaned forward
and looked at her intensely. "I've already done a bit of experimenting
and I found out that I don't need the wand, I can make anything I want
happen just by snapping my fingers."
```

Harry is intentionally setting himself up to be an embodiment of this
trope: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFingersnap .
Harry will **snap his fingers** many times over the course of this series.

Step 4: Make a cardboard poster.

This is a tounge-in-cheek reference to how most elementary and middle
schools handle science, especially at science fairs, which culminate
in students making presentations of their experiment and results,
usually on cardboard.

Suddenly Neville gasped and took a step back. "I remember that voice!

Maybe Gryffindor wasn't as wonderful as she had thought.
```

* original
* spoiler

This is a departure from the original series.  Primarily, Gryffindors
here are portrayed as bad as the Slytherins, just a different type of
bully.  This is also likely the reason that Neville joins Hufflepuff
instead of Gryffindor (as in the original series he might have been
inspired by people stepping up to help him).

Harry Potter hissed at that, a frightening sort of sound that could
have come from a live snake and made both her and Neville flinch.

Harry speaks Parseltongue, blah blah **mysterious dark side** blah
