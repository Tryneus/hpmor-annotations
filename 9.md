You never did know what tiny event might upset the course of your
master plan.

This is a flash-forward to later in the chapter.

```
Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a quick
look at the face than anything else. He was still trying to get
himself under control from his encounter with the ghosts. The sad, the
really sad, the really truly sad thing was that he did seem to be
getting himself under control again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like he
should have taken at least a day. Maybe a whole lifetime. Maybe just
never.
```

* spoiler

Harry's first reaction upon seeing the ghosts was to believe that
nobody had ever really died (39/`I thought there was an afterlife`).
He was understandably upset to learn that this was not the case.

```
"I mean -" Harry whispered. "Not that I have a problem with that -
it's just - I mean - how's that possible? You can't just mix two
different species together and get viable offspring! It ought to
scramble the genetic instructions for every organ that's different
between the two species - it'd be like trying to build," they didn't
have cars so he couldn't use a scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, "a
half-carriage half-boat or something..."
```

Harry later concludes that all magical humanoids are just humans with
weird magic genes.

```
And talk about your foregone conclusions. Harry didn't see why
Hermione had been so tense about it. In what weird alternative
universe would that girl not be Sorted into Ravenclaw? If Hermione
Granger didn't go to Ravenclaw then there was no good reason for
Ravenclaw House to exist.
```

* original

Hermione is in Gryffindor in the original series.  A common criticism
of the original series is that Gryffindor is the "good" house,
Slytherin is the "bad" house, and the other two are just filler.

And Severus Snape gripping his empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, so
hard that the silver was slowly deforming.
```

* spoiler

Severus Snape has very complicated feelings about Harry.  He was in
love with Harry's mother, hated his father, and arguably caused both
their deaths.  He may also already know something about Harry's
**mysterious dark side** at this point.

More likely, however, he's just playing the part expected of the Evil
Potions Master (it is later revealed that he is *very* good at keeping
up this act).

```
In the back of his mind, he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely
conscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so,
whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds
once per year.
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Ironically, the hat *becomes* conscious when Harry puts it on
precisely because he is thinking this.
