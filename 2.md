This is the code you would write in the C programming language to
include the standard disclaimer.

"Of course it was my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything."
```

Flash-forward to when Harry is blaming himself for Hermione's death
(90/`Of course it's my fault.`).

```
Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just that
strange part of him which had already been convinced
```

This "part of Harry" is likely his **mysterious dark side**.

"I don't sleep right," Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. "My
sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours
later, every day. I can't fall asleep any earlier than that, and then
the next day I go to sleep two hours later than that. 10PM, 12AM, 2AM,
4AM, until it goes around the clock. Even if I try to wake up early,
it makes no difference and I'm a wreck that whole day. That's why I
haven't been going to a normal school up until now."
```

Dumbledore caused this condition by secretly giving Harry the potion
meant for students using Time-Turners (119/`I snuck invisibly into
your bedroom in Oxford and administered the potion that is given to
students with Time-Turners`) as part of his **prophecy-threading**
project.

"No, I'm sure this won't be a problem - I'll find a solution in time.
```

The solution is, in fact, a Time-Turner.
