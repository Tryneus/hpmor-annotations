In the original, Harry was saved by his mother's love.

in HPMOR, his mother's love had nothing to do with it.  His scar
doesn't contain all of the Dark Lord's magical power, although the
scar is tied in some way to the **sense of doom** he feels around
Quirrell, and thus probably to his **mysterious dark side**.  Centaurs
(or at least some centaurs) do in fact fear him.

Hermione may not understand that Harry can only retrieve books that he
has put into the pouch.

Harry buys her one of these pouches for her Birthday, partially
because she's his friend, but also perhaps partially because of the
human tendency for Reciprocation discussed in the previous chapter
(22/`pouch for her birthday`).
