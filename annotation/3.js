This doesn't appear to be a well-known reference.  It's either
obscure, or a reference to the shaky legal status of fanfiction.

"But then the question is - who?"
    `,
    note: `
This is *not* a flash-forward like the others.  This quote appears in
the third paragraph of the chapter: "Am I - could I be - maybe - you
never know - if I'm not - but then the question is - who?".  In the
context of the rest of the chapter this is probably supposed to make
the reader wonder who Harry really is (with the weak implication from
the phrasing that he might be You Know Who).

"I had the strangest feeling that I knew him..." Harry rubbed his
forehead. "And that I shouldn't ought to shake his hand." Like meeting
someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically
wrong... that wasn't really it at all, but Harry couldn't find words.

More hints about Harry's **mysterious dark side**, and the first minor
occurance of the **sense of doom** surrounding Professor Quirrell.

discovers a humorous substance known as "Flubber" which has various
bouncing-related properties.

Harry desperately didn't want to miss a single item for sale, in case
it was one of the three you needed to complete the cycle of infinite
<em>wish</em> spells.

    note: `
Apparently the author did not have a particular set of three items in
mind.  The most common infinite wish hack in modern times uses a
single candle of invocation, but infinite wishes can be achieved with
only two items even in first edition Dungeons and Dragons.

"Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it
wasn't. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond
clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of
yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the
word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like
You-Know-Who.

It is unclear whether this is a magical property of the name or
related to Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note of
confusion, a sense of something wrong about that story; and it should
have been a part of Harry's art to notice that tiny note, but he was
distracted.

    note: `
Several things are obviously wrong with this story.  If it was just
Voldemort and the Potters in the home, how does anyone know that
happened?  See **the real story behind the scar**.
