"I don't sleep right," Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. "My
sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours
later, every day. I can't fall asleep any earlier than that, and then
the next day I go to sleep two hours later than <em>that.</em> 10PM,
12AM, 2AM, 4AM, until it goes around the clock. Even if I try to wake
up early, it makes no difference and I'm a wreck that whole day.
That's why I haven't been going to a normal school up until now."
