More Lord of the Rings references.  Dumbledore, as the mysterious old
wizard, it likened to Gandalf.  Harry is saying that Snape is too evil

Hogwarts.

Severus obviously has some knowledge about the Lord of the Rings (and
other Muggle culture, as he showed earlier), so Harry's attempt at
encoding his statement to Dumbledore failed.
