probably as part of his **prophecy-threading** project {79/"Albus,"
Minerva said, surprised at how steady her own voice was, "did you
leave those notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?"}.  That's the real way
he knows Harry has it, not the story-logic he gives as part of his

he added the note specifically so that he could have this moment where
Harry's doubts proved unfounded.

Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible effort. "Ah,
Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is that you begin
laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny, because when
you're wise, Harry, you start getting the jokes!" The old wizard wiped
tears away from his eyes. "Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft evil will shall evil
mar indeed, in very deed."

    note: `
Dumbledore knows the truth about Harry's **mysterious dark side**, or
at least mostly understands it.  The joke he's getting is that Tom
Riddle's own cold, calculating intelligence is now being turned toward
redeeming Draco Malfoy.

secondary antagonist (behind Voldemort).  Over the course of the

deserting the Death Eaters prior to the final battle.

Dumbledore was writing instructions on how to turn the potion of
eagle's splendor into a potion which makes someone permanently more
beatiful, as part of his **prophecy-threading** project.  Lily gave
the improved potion to Petunia {1/I drank this potion and I was sick

Vernon Dursley, which is why Harry is so well-educated.

In many video games, scenes are written in such a way that players
cannot put themselves in a position where it is impossible to win.

quest item), the rest of the story would be unbeatable.

A jab at the original series, where the super-secure chamber holding
the Philosopher's stone is secured in such a way that first-year

the Headmaster pretends is a fake set of traps designed as on obstacle
course for Gryffindors trying to get to the "forbidden" thing at the
end.
