This passage points out how trivial the plot would be without the
other changes made from the original series, besides Harry's
upbringing as a rationalist.  This serves as both a justification for
how complicated the plot gets as well as a disparagement of the
characters from the original series.

"Slytherin!  Just kidding!  Ravenclaw!" is that Dumbledore did exactly
this, if more subtly, because he didn't like the hat's choice for the
