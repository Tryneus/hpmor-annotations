ph'nglui mglw'nafh J. K. Rowling wgah'nagl fhtagn
    `,
    note: `
A reference to the Cthulhu mythos, with Rowling replacing Cthulhu in
the quote.  The original quote is "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh
wgah'nagl fhtagn", which translates from the fictional language
R'lyehian as "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."
Interestingly, J.K. Rowling here replaces both Cthulhu and his resting
place.  So the translation would be "In his house at Rowling, dead
J. K. waits dreaming."  This is possibly a mistake, but more likely
the author noted the similarity in pronunciation between R'lyeh and
Rowling.

The implications for the true meaning of this author's note, and
indeed the rest of the series, are clearly enormous.

A flash-forward to a student talking about Quirrell later in the
chapter.  Interestingly, all of the other title quotes thus far have
either been from Harry's word's/thoughts, or else about Harry.  So
perhaps this is an early hint that Harry and Quirrell are actually
kind of the same person due to Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

Alternatively, they may simply be the most interesting and thus
title-quote-worthy characters.

    `,
    note: `
This is a spell left on the hat by Salazar Slytherin.  It speaks in
parseltongue, which Harry can understand because his **mysterious dark
side** makes him the Heir of Slytherin.  It is giving Harry the first
hint to the location of the Chamber of Secrets.

In the original, the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is accessed by
speaking Parseltongue to a snake-engraved sink in the second-floor
girls' bathroom.  The snake could refer to this, or to the basilisk
itself, a snake-like creature guarding the Chamber of Secrets, which
knows forgotten magics stored away by Salazar Slytherin.

secrecy so he could ask him about it, that would be an excellent time
to have some Comed-Tea handy.
    `,
    note: `
This may be the **Comed-Tea** influencing his mind, which is a hint
that Draco's reaction to this event would include an event that would
make Harry spit out his drink even if he was trying not to, which may
be a subtle hint that this is a bigger deal than Harry is thinking at
the moment.

students had to not wear any clothes for the whole school year, or
everyone was going to be transformed into cats.

Interestingly, Harry is arguably making *the exact same mistake* that
Hermione made when *she* was investigating the **Comed-Tea**

Hypothesis that the **Comed-Tea** is omnipotent and altering reality
to make him laugh.  In his defense, it's difficult to come up with a
negative test for that hypothesis.

Dumbledore wasn't around to hear this.  The two main hypothesis are
that he was observing Harry invisibly (for which there is some
speculative evidence at the end of {6/a last whisper from

logic the Hat mentioned) on him.

Why, yes. That sounded like a remarkably good idea once Harry had
actually thought of it.

So very obvious in retrospect, and yet somehow, Option 3c and Option
3d just hadn't occurred to him.
    `,
    note: `
In the original series, Harry and his friends consistently attempt to
have adventures without informing adults, even when it would have been
practical or advisable.  While this is an expected departure from the
original series, it is also a nod towards the sometimes-stupid heroism
of its main characters.

It is guarded by an elaborate series of dangerous and potentially
lethal traps, and you cannot possibly get past all of them, especially
if you are only in your first year.
    `,
    note: `
One of the author's favorite side-games is taking things from the
original series that made no sense and trying to change the world to
be consistent with them.

In this case, the idea that Dumbledore would guard the stone with a
set of traps that first-year students can circumvent is ridiculous, so
it's instead turned into a sort of obstacle course for Gryffindors,
with the actual defenses of the stone being somewhat more subtle.
