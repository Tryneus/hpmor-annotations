A reference to the Cthulhu mythos, with Rowling replacing Cthulhu in
the quote.  The original quote is "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh
wgah'nagl fhtagn", which translates from the fictional language
R'lyehian as "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."
Interestingly, J.K. Rowling here replaces both Cthulhu and his resting
place.  So the translation would be "In his house at Rowling, dead
J. K. waits dreaming."  This is possibly a mistake, but more likely
the author noted the similarity in pronunciation between R'lyeh and
Rowling.

The implications for the true meaning of this author's note, and
indeed the rest of the series, are clearly enormous.

A flash-forward to a student talking about Quirrell later in the
chapter.  Interestingly, all of the other title quotes thus far have
either been from Harry's word's/thoughts, or else about Harry.  So
perhaps this is an early hint that Harry and Quirrell are actually
kind of the same person due to Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

Alternatively, they may simply be the most interesting and thus
title-quote-worthy characters.

parseltongue, which Harry can understand because his **mysterious dark

hint to the location of the Chamber of Secrets.

In the original, the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is accessed by
speaking Parseltongue to a snake-engraved sink in the second-floor
girls' bathroom.  The snake could refer to this, or to the basilisk
itself, a snake-like creature guarding the Chamber of Secrets, which
knows forgotten magics stored away by Salazar Slytherin.
