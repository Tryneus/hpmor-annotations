Awareness, referring specifically to the Sorting Hat achieving
self-awareness due to Harry's unique perspective.

Harry glanced over briefly at his new House-mate, more to get a
quick look at the face than anything else. He was still trying to
get himself under control from his encounter with the ghosts. The
sad, the really sad, the really truly sad thing was that he

seemed ill-fitting. Like he should have taken at least a day. Maybe
a whole lifetime. Maybe just never.

Severus Snape has very complicated feelings about Harry.  He was in

More likely, however, he's just playing the part expected of the Evil
Potions Master (it is later revealed that he is *very* good at keeping
up this act).
