This is a modified version of a phrase from Elvish in the Lord of the

This is probably the first hint that Harry is behind the game, since
he's the only other character who has been explicitly called out as
acting a little insane and spreading chaos wherever he goes.

cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!"}

Harry probably doesn't consider this hypothesis, because his actually
usually look less insane from the inside, and this is the first time
he's encountering himself from the outside.

M. C. Escher was an artist known for depicting impossible objects.
This, specifically may be calling back to one of Escher's most famous
works, Relativity
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_%28M._C._Escher%29).
However, this bit is somewhat incorrect, Escher did not produce many
paintings - these sorts of works were typically lithographs.

That sounded strangely familiar but Harry couldn't recall where he'd
heard it before.

It's unclear exactly what this is referring to.  Several hypothesis:

* Harry's **mysterious dark side** has in fact heard this advice
  before.

* It sounds similar to the left-hand rule for solving mazes.

* It's a reference to the Left-Hand Path, which is a generic occult
  term for a variety of black magics.

It's worth remembering whenever you hear the word "riddle" that it
might be a reference to Tom Riddle, which can refer to either
Voldemort or Harry (due to his **mysterious dark side**).  (Harry is
talking to her, so she's hearing him.)

This particular occurance is somewhat weak, however, and may just be a
coincidence.

The fact that this random portrait already knows exactly how many

there's some sort of precognition in play (in this case, Harry already

controlling the portrait in some more direct way than old messages
passed through other portraits.)

It was likely no mistake in the original series that the incantation

Here, that relation is unwittingly abused by Harry.

Harry is definitely asking the wrong questions.  This game implies the
existence of a bunch of new and powerful, but not necessarily hostile,
elements of the world that he doesn't understand, and he's still
concerned with whether or not it's fair and whether or not he can win.

Also, there is a certain correspondence between this and the test with
the **Comed-Tea** that Harry put Hermione through on the train.  In
both cases there's a mysterious phenomenon to investigate, and in both
cases the investigator asks entirely the wrong questions.
