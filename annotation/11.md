"Omake" is a non-canonical extra.
```

* note

Omake literally means "extra" in Japanese.  The term here is borrowed
from Anime/Manga culture.

```
OMAKE FILES #1: 72 Hours to Victory
```

* original

This passage points out how trivial the plot would be without the
other changes made from the original series, besides Harry's
upbringing as a rationalist.  This serves as both a justification for
how complicated the plot gets as well as a disparagement of the
characters from the original series.

```
What options are available at my user level?

After that it didn't take long -

"ROOT!"
```

The implication is that the Sorting Hat is analagous to a computer
system, and that Harry has hacked it, gaining root-level access (total
control of the system).

```
"SLYTHERIN!"

Seeing the look of horror on Harry Potter's face, Fred Weasley thought
faster than he ever had in his life. In a single motion he whipped out
his wand, whispered "Silencio!" and then "Changemyvoiceio!" and
finally "Ventriliquo!â€¯"

"Just kidding!" said Fred Weasley. "GRYFFINDOR!"
```

* spoiler
* foreshadowing

Later on, Professor Quirrell's hypothesis for why the Hat said
"Slytherin!  Just kidding!  Ravenclaw!" is that Dumbledore did exactly
this, if more subtly, because he didn't like the hat's choice for the
boy who lived (20/`Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived`).
