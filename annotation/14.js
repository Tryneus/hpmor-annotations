Apparently that business with refusing offers of monetary rewards
until you got a magic item actually worked in real life, not just
computer games.
    `,
    note: `
In many computer games, particularly RPGs, upon completing a quest the
player is usually given a reward.  If the player refuses that reward,
the quest-giver will usually offer a different means of compensation.
From a balance perspective, this is typically done so a player doesn't
feel discouraged from playing a certain type of character.  In a
similar way, McGonagall is trying to find a way to encourage Harry to
be good by rewarding this behavior.

If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he
would never let it escape his grasp until the day he died.
    `,
    note: `
The cloak was left by Dumbledore, just like in the original, probably
as part of his **prophecy-threading** project {79/"Albus," Minerva
said, surprised at how steady her own voice was, "did you leave those
notes under Mr. Potter's pillow?"}.

Dumbledore also posesses the Elder Wand, another Deathly Hallow, which
changes hands when its owner is defeated, an event which Dumbledore
expects to coincide with his death.

Shortly after Harry receives the cloak, Dumbledore will conspicuously
*not* steal it, even though he has the opportunity to, and will tell
Harry that Harry should be more suspicious next time somebody says not
to trust him {17/I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we
must all do our best to be wise. I will only ask that you think twice
and ponder three times again, the next time someone tells you to
distrust me.}.  Assuming that he didn't write the note this way just
because the prophecies told him to, it seems likely that he did it in
order to make Harry trust him more by proving a strawman wrong.
