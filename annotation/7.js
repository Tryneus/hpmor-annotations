Remember that the trunk is walking around on its own.

This is a very confusing comment, as it's later claimed that genetic
predisposition to magic is basically discrete -- you're muggle, squib,

with nothing in-between {23/either you have two stones or you
don't. Either you're a wizard or not.}.  It's possible that his

Another of the lines that **ship Harry and Draco**.

The first of **Luna's prophecies**, and also the most irritating.  All
of the other prophecies turn out to be true in an extremely literal,
if surprising, way.  This one doesn't appear to have a similar literal
correspondence.

The Author's Note from the next chapter is relevant here:
    
One alert reviewer asked whether, if Luna is a seer, that means this
is going to be an HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret that FFN does
not allow me any larger font size in which to say NO. It honestly
hadn't occurred to me that Luna might be a real seer - I'll have to
decide whether to run with that or not - but I think we can all safely
assume that if Luna is a seer, she said something about "light
planting a seed in darkness", and Xenophilius, as always, interpreted
this in rather the wrong way.

So it's possible that the subsequent prophecies were real because the
author decided it was a fun idea, and this one just dates from before
that realization.  It's also possible that this prophecy will become
literally true in the Epilogue, which has not yet been written.
