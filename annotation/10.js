Harry is worried by his discussion with Draco {7/Our powers have

looking for a way to stem the tide.  This is not far from how
Voldemort rediscovered lost magic from the basilisk guarding the
Chamber of Secrets {49/He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to
power}, but it is unlikely the Sorting Hat could pass much knowledge
to Harry due to the **Interdict of Merlin**.
