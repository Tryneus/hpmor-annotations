Phlogiston is an old explanation for why things burn with little
predictive power (they burn because they have phlogiston in them).
Elan Vital is a similarly meaningless explanation for what makes thing
alive.  Harry "emergence" and "complexity" are hand-wavy explanations
sometimes used by people discussing artificial intelligence, and in
particular the nature of consciousness.

Harry, I've seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts, it would
break your heart to know how many. And, when you're happy, you don't
behave like one of those children, not at all. You smile at strangers,
you hug people, I put my hand on your shoulder and you didn't
flinch. But sometimes, only sometimes, you say or do something that
seems very much like... someone who spent his first eleven years
locked in a cellar.

As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.

"Hermione Granger."

"What?" Harry said, his hand still on the door.

"Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts."

"Who is she?"

There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor
McGonagall was gone.
    `,
    note: `
It is less than clear that this whisper came from Professor
McGonagall.

Remember that Professor Quirrell is in the Leaky Cauldron {3/That was
Professor Quirinus Quirrell}.  Quirrell later demonstrates the
ability to make his whispers carry magically {74/a whisper, carrying
through the door as though no door were present}.

Another hypothesis is that Dumbledore is there, invisible, and
whispered this to Harry as part of his **prophecy-threading**
project.  This seems more likely, since arguably a Harry who never met
Hermione would be much more likely to have accidentally destroyed the
world, and Quirrell has no obvious reason to introduce the two.

There is some evidence that Dumbledore is spying invisibly on Harry:

* In the aftermath of this chapter, he doesn't actually need Minerva's
  report, which would be consistent with is having observed everything
  himself.

* Later {12/entire game of Quidditch}, he casually mentions
  something Harry said when he wasn't around in order troll him.
