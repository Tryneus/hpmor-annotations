Phlogiston is an old explanation for why things burn with little

Elan Vital is a similarly meaningless explanation for what makes thing
alive.  Harry "emergence" and "complexity" are hand-wavy explanations
sometimes used by people discussing artificial intelligence, and in
particular the nature of consciousness.

It is less than clear that this whisper came from Professor
McGonagall.

Remember that Professor Quirrell is in the Leaky Cauldron {3/That was
Professor Quirinus Quirrell}.  Quirrell later demonstrates the
ability to make his whispers carry magically {74/a whisper, carrying
through the door as though no door were present}.

Another hypothesis is that Dumbledore is there, invisible, and
whispered this to Harry as part of his prophecy-threading project.
This seems more likely, since arguably a Harry who never met
Hermione would be much more likely to have accidentally destroyed the
world, and Quirrell has no obvious reason to introduce the two.

There is some evidence that Dumbledore is spying invisibly on Harry:

* In the aftermath of this chapter, he doesn't actually need Minerva's
  report, which would be consistent with is having observed everything
  himself.

* Later {12/entire game of Quidditch}, he casually mentions
  something Harry said when he wasn't around in order troll him.
