This is a bit of a prod at the source material, in which Draco is
first portrayed the stereotypical villain with minions in his own
class.  Here, it is explained how such a thing happens, which only
serves to make it seem more ridiculous.  The minions themselves,
Crabbe and Goyle, hamfistedly employ every stereotypical minion action
available to them, perhaps an explanation of how stupid the characters
were in the original series.
