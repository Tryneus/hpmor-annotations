The Defence class in general is a large departure from the original
series, but to portray the classroom as such shows that Quirrell is
not as antiquated as the rest of the wizarding world, and is open
to taking ideas from Muggles.

This is a bit of a prod at the source material, in which Draco is
first portrayed the stereotypical villain with minions in his own
class.  Here, it is explained how such a thing happens, which only
serves to make it seem more ridiculous.  The minions themselves,
Crabbe and Goyle, hamfistedly employ every stereotypical minion action
available to them, perhaps an explanation of how stupid the characters
were in the original series.

This comes into play later.  Because of this property, mountain trolls
can be transfigured into something small, smuggled somewhere, and then
untransfigured (normally this would kill the creature).  {108/I wore

killing curse doesn't work on them, so by Quirrell's logic they can't
have brains, and yet they're capable of complicated actions.

reminding him that some things cannot be compromised.
