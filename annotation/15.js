"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
will learn at Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There was no trace

around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been
warned."

While this is the exact same intro given by McGonagall in the original
series, the rest of this scene establishes much more hard and fast
rules on Transfiguration, with more of a scientific basis.  This

series.
