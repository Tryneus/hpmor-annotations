And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version of
Evanescence's "My Immortal", which has never happened before.

just kidding
```

* reference

A common meme is that bad fanfiction has to include at least one song
by a band that highschool kids liked a lot at the time it was written.

```
Its song had implied so: Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep
all year and I work one day...
```

This is not the actual sorting hat song, but instead it is a reference
to The Lumberjack Song by Monty Python:

I can tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,
intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your
scar. Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being
under my brim.

The intelligence/personality/etc. of the dark lord *is* participating
in this conversation, since it's just rolled into Harry.  See the
topic page on his **mysterious dark side**.

```
"When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor McGonagall
told you that she sometimes saw something inside you that didn't seem
to come from a loving family. You thought of how Hermione, after you
returned from helping Neville, told you that you had seemed 'scary'."

Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal - just
responding to the situations in which he found himself, that was
all. But Professor McGonagall seemed to think that there was more to
it than that.

"That you don't like yourself when you're angry. That it is like
wielding a sword whose hilt is sharp enough to draw blood from your
hand, or looking at the world through a monocle of ice that freezes
your eye even as it sharpens your vision."

"I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I cannot
count them. I just know that your chances don't feel good. They feel
very not-good."
```

It's possible this is affected by Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

```
"Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought before you
substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you remembered
was how you considered lining up all the blood purists and
guillotining them. And now you are telling yourself you were not
serious, but you were. If you could do it this very moment and no one
would ever know, you would.
```

* spoiler

This is an interesting statemnt, because Harry ponders this question
at some length later in the series (85/`batman`) and eventually comes
to the conclusion that he will at least try to achieve all of his
goals without killing anyone, so long as nobody dies because of his
reluctance.
