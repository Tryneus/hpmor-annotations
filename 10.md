And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version of
Evanescence's "My Immortal", which has never happened before.

```

* reference

A common meme is that bad fanfiction has to include at least one song
by a band that highschool kids liked a lot at the time it was written.

```
Its song had implied so: Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep
all year and I work one day...
```

This is not the actual sorting hat song, but instead it is a reference
to The Lumberjack Song by Monty Python:

can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created you?
```

* spoiler
* callback

Harry is worried by his discussion with Draco (7/`Our powers have
grown weaker`) that magic may be draining from the world, so he is
looking for a way to stem the tide.  This is not far from how
Voldemort rediscovered lost magic from the basilisk guarding the
Chamber of Secrets (49/`He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began his climb to
power`), but it is unlikely the Sorting Hat could pass much knowledge
to Harry due to the **Interdict of Merlin**.

I can tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind,
intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your
scar. Otherwise it would be participating in this conversation, being
under my brim.
```

The intelligence/personality/etc. of the dark lord *is* participating
in this conversation, since it's just rolled into Harry.  See the
topic page on his **mysterious dark side**.

I am not Dark Lord material!

"Yes, you are. You really, really are."
```

Considering Harry's **mysterious dark side** comes from a Dark Lord,
this is a really big clue.

```
"When I spoke of your anger, you remembered how Professor McGonagall
told you that she sometimes saw something inside you that didn't seem
to come from a loving family. You thought of how Hermione, after you
returned from helping Neville, told you that you had seemed 'scary'."

No, what you remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood

Harry actually does decapitate all the Death Eaters (114/`(Black

Harry later generals the Chaos Legion, whose battle cry is "DOOM",
chanted to the tune of the Imperial March (TODO: reference).

Harry gave a mental nod. To himself, he seemed pretty normal - just
responding to the situations in which he found himself, that was
all. But Professor McGonagall seemed to think that there was more to
it than that.

"I cannot give you exact statistics. I cannot know them so I cannot

It's possible this is affected by Harry's **mysterious dark side**.

If you could do it this very moment and no one would ever know, you
would.
```

* spoiler

This is an interesting statemnt, because Harry ponders this question
at some length later in the series (85/`batman`) and eventually comes
to the conclusion that he will at least try to achieve all of his
goals without killing anyone, so long as nobody dies because of his
reluctance.
